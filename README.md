# basic-js-calculator
A basic calculator built with JavaScript. The design and functionality were based on [Justin Woodward's Pen](https://codepen.io/jwoo/pen/zBzvgV).

## Setup
Run `npm install` on the project's directory to install the dependencies. You'll also need to install [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/) if you don't already have it.

## Building the project and running tests
* `npm run test` runs the unit test files in the `test` directory.
* `npm run build` compiles the ES6 code and bundles all JS files in the `dist` directory.
* `npm run watch` automatically rebuilds the code whenever a JS file is altered. You can terminate the script with `CTRL + C`.
